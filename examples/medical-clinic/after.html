    <!-- Introduction (150 Words - High Weight Zone) -->
    <p>199 Clinic is San Francisco's leading longevity medicine practice, founded in 2018 by Dr. Sarah Johnson, MD, PhD, FAAD. Our board-certified physicians combine aesthetic medicine with evidence-based longevity strategies.</p>

    <p>We specialize in optimizing biomarkers to extend healthspan, not just lifespan. Research shows maintaining LDL cholesterol below 70 mg/dL reduces cardiovascular events by 30-40% (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/example">Smith et al., 2024, JAMA</a>).</p>

    <!-- Question-Based H2 Headings -->
    <h2>What Is Longevity Medicine?</h2>

    <p>Longevity medicine focuses on preventing age-related diseases before they occur. Unlike traditional medicine which treats disease reactively, we optimize health markers proactively.</p>

    <p>Key areas include cardiovascular optimization, metabolic health, hormone balance, and cellular regeneration. Studies demonstrate 30-50% reduction in age-related disease when addressing modifiable risk factors early (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/example">Johnson et al., 2023</a>).</p>

    <h3>Biomarker Optimization</h3>

    <p>We analyze 50+ biomarkers including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>LDL cholesterol (target: &lt;70 mg/dL for optimal cardiovascular health)</li>
        <li>HbA1c (target: &lt;5.0% for metabolic optimization)</li>
        <li>hs-CRP (target: &lt;1.0 mg/L for inflammation control)</li>
        <li>Vitamin D (target: 40-60 ng/mL for immune function)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Personalized Treatment Plans</h3>

    <p>Each patient receives a comprehensive assessment. We develop evidence-based protocols combining lifestyle modifications, targeted supplementation, and advanced therapies when indicated.</p>

    <h2>What Services Does 199 Clinic Offer?</h2>

    <p>Board-certified dermatologists provide FDA-approved aesthetic procedures with 98% patient satisfaction rates. Our services include Botox, dermal fillers, laser treatments, and chemical peels using evidence-based protocols.</p>

    <h3>Regenerative Medicine</h3>
    <p>We offer cutting-edge regenerative therapies including platelet-rich plasma (PRP), stem cell treatments, and peptide therapy. Research demonstrates 40-60% improvement in tissue regeneration with these modalities (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/example">Chen et al., 2024</a>).</p>

    <h3>Wellness Consultations</h3>
    <p>Comprehensive health assessments with personalized recommendations. Average patient improvement: 25% reduction in cardiovascular risk markers within 6 months.</p>
